	// The service name to handle the connection events.<br/>In the initial version, we expected to use streams to improve the efficiency<br/>of requests in `ConnectionHandler`. But unfortunately, events between different<br/>streams are out of order. It causes the `OnSocketCreated` event to may arrive<br/>later than `OnReceivedBytes`.<br/>So we added the `ConnectionUnaryHandler` service since v5.0.25 and forced<br/>the use of Unary in it to avoid ordering problems.
